Block Diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The block diagram below shows the components of ESP32-S3-USB-OTG and their interconnections.

   ESP32-S3-USB-OTG Block Diagram (click to enlarge)

Please note that the external interface corresponding to the ``USB_HOST D+ D-`` signal in the functional block diagram is ``USB DEV``, which means that ESP32-S3 is used as a device to receive signals from other USB hosts. The external interface corresponding to the ``USB_DEV D+ D-`` signal is ``USB HOST``, which means that ESP32-S3 acts as a host to control other devices.

Power Supply Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three power supply methods for the development board:

1. Power supply through the ``Micro_USB`` interface

   -  Use the USB cable (standard A to Micro-B) to connect the motherboard to a power supply device, and set battery switch to OFF. Please note that in this power supply mode, only the motherboard and display are powered.

2. Power supply through the ``USB_DEV`` interface

   -  Set ``DEV_VBUS_EN`` to high level, and set battery switch to OFF. This mode can supply power to the ``USB HOST`` interface. The lithium battery will be charged at the same time (if the lithium battery is installed)

3. Power supply through battery

   -  Set ``BOOST_EN`` to high level, and set battery switch to ON. You should solder a 1-Serial lithium battery (3.7 V ~ 4.2 V) to the power solder joint reserved on the back of the motherboard first. This mode can supply power to the ``USB HOST`` interface at the same time. The battery interface description is as follows:

USB HOST Interface Power Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``USB HOST`` interface (Type-A female port) can supply power to the connected USB device. The power supply voltage is 5 V and the maximum current is 500 mA.

-  There are two power supply methods for the ``USB HOST`` interface:

   1. Power is supplied through the ``USB_DEV`` interface, and the 5 V power is directly from the power source connected to the interface.
   2. Power is supplied through the lithium battery, and the 3.6 V ~ 4.2 V voltage of the lithium battery is boosted to 5 V through the Boost circuit. The working status of Boost IC can be controlled by BOOST_EN/GPIO13, set high to enable Boost.

-  500 mA current limiting circuit:

   1. The current limiting IC MIC2005A can limit the maximum output current of the ``USB HOST`` interface to 500 mA. Please set the ``IDEV_LIMIT_EN`` (GPIO17) to high level to enable the current-limiting IC to output voltage.

   USB Interface Switch Circuit (click to enlarge)

-  When **USB_SEL** (GPIO18) is set to high level, the USB D+/D- Pin (GPIO19, 20) will be connected to ``USB_DEV D+ D-``. Then you can use the ``USB HOST`` interface (Type-A female Port) to connect other USB devices.
-  When **USB_SEL** (GPIO18) is set to low level, the USB D+/D- Pin (GPIO19, 20) will be connected to ``USB_HOST D+ D-``. Then you can use the ``USB DEV`` interface (Type-A male port) to connect to host like PC.
-  **USB_SEL** is pulled low level by default.
